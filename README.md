# Github Copilot theme

A VSCode implementation of the Benjamin Benais' [Copilot Theme](https://github.com/benjaminbenais/copilot-theme), but with higher contrast.

### Notes:

This theme is still in progress. Currently JavaScript & TypeScript work the best with this theme. More language support will be added overtime. Please feel free to open a pull request if you notice something wrong or would like to make a change.

Font used: [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
